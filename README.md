## Usage

To locally install the project clone this repository first. Then navigate to the project folder and run the following command to instal all node modules (dependencies):

```
npm i
```

To start the client locally run:

```
npm run dev
```

To build the client code run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a dist folder with the packed client code. This folder can then be used in the server project.
